# Requirements
## Introduction
* Hospitals are one of the most important institutions with responsibilites to keep everyone in the country healthy essentially making it so that the country keeps on running.Any country without proper medical institutions will have the most bizzare outbursts during a wide spread disease leading to its economic downfall because of the lack of human resources.Hence to maintain such institutions a large amount of fund is invested,maintaining a proper system to keep record of all these things while the operations continue is a huge task that is where management systems come in handy multiple management systems manage different types of work operations such as finance,record management etc.
* One of those system is the main concept behind this project.Keeping tabs on patient is a very tiresome task as the scale of the institution grows hence comes in the record management system which keeps tab of the entire system for the institution and make their task easier where they only have to focus on treatment and not other things.Usually this can be done using multiple different systems and platforms such as Mysql along with an interface made from python or JS but this project will be made using C language although it is not the most efficient or the most flexible it is what I have on my hands so here goes nothing...

### History
As we all know management system was the trend to help institutions focus on ther job and what better place to use that than medical institutions where we want the essential workers to focus on their work rather than those tedious tasks so that they can be more productive while paying less heed to things that can be easily managed using a system.
There are multiple management system used in medical institutions to work with things like managing the funds,the salary for the workers,keeping tabs on the schedule of the workers,keeping the records of the patient in the hospital and their medical history,etc.These are done using multiple platforms,frameworks with different management plans.Models with more efficiency as well as models with more flexibility are present each of them have a differne feature they focus on and integrate themselves in the environment and each successful model fuels the next better model.

### Operational pros for the institution

1.Ease of operation for the Institution i.e its easier to store the records of the patient reducing the tedious and repetitive steps.
2.A cleaner and structured management of the records to avoid over fitting and avoid mix-ups because the records are basically the patients life in severe cases where mix-ups might prove dangerous.
3.Room for datasets and literature material for future models with improvements based on the data.

## Costs
![Description](Link to Pic)
* non-volatile Memory on the system running the system. 
* Cloud space if the system is running through a private cloud.
* Registe memeory to run the software on the system.
* Technically able workers to use the system efficiently.
